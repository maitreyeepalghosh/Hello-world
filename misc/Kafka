What is Kafka?
Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system that is designed to be fast, scalable, and durable.
Kafka maintains feeds of messages in topics. Producers write data to topics and consumers read from topics. Since Kafka is a distributed system, topics are partitioned and replicated across multiple nodes.
